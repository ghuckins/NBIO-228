    "1. A matrix acts most simply on its eigenvectors. For each eigenvalue/eigenvector pair $\\lambda_i,v_i$, we can write $Av_i=\\lambda_i v_i$. Collecting all eigenvectors into the columns of the matrix $V$, we can write $AV=VD$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix whose $i^{th}$ entry is the $i^{th}$ eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$.\n",
    "2. If $A$ has a full set of $n$ linearly independent eigenvectors, then $V$ is invertible, and we can write $A=VDV^{-1}$. This is called the **eigendecomposition** of $A$. \n",
    "3. The eigendecomposition gives insight into the structure of $A$. It shows how if we change to an eigenvector basis, $A$ is diagonal. It makes computing powers of $A$ trivial, since $A^k=VD^kV^{-1}$.\n",
    "4. A simple but powerful application (that we will study in more detail later on), is to predict the stability of a linear dynamical system. \n",

    "\n",
    "If $A$ has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors - which is the case, for example, if $A$ is symmetric - then the eigenvector matrix $V$ has linearly independent columns and is therefore invertible. We can right-multiply our equation by $V^{-1}$, leaving \n",

    "Consider the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ — the same matrix we were working with before. We've already determined eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Use those quantities to find $V$ and $D$ and diagonalize $A$. (You can use a tool like NumPy to find the inverse of $V$). Then, prove that the diagonalization is equal to $A.$\n",

    "\n",
    "Stated another way, if we use the standard basis, the matrix components are found in $A$. Vectors transform as $\\textbf{x}\\to A\\textbf{x}$. If, on the other hand, we use a basis of eigenvectors, the matrix components are found in $D$, and vectors transform as $\\textbf{c}\\to D\\textbf{c}$. The diagonalization $A=VDV^{-1}$ simply expresses the *change of basis formula* that takes us to a very special basis: the eigenbasis. The advantage of being in this new basis is that we get the diagonal matrix $D$, which is extremely easy to understand and compute with. "
