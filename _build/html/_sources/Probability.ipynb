    "It's impossible to do experimental science without understanding probability. No matter what field you are in, probability permeates every aspect of the scientific process. Hypotheses often ask not whether changing a certain condition makes a particular outcome happen, but whether it makes that outcome *more or less likely*. And when we analyze data, we often ask: What's the *probability* that I would have obtained this result, if my hypothesis were not true?\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of why we cover probability in this class is because neuroscience is an experimental science. But probability is also fundamental to how we understand the brain. We often talk about neurons like they are deterministic machines — as if a neuron that responds to a particular stimulus will always fire, and fire in exactly the same way, when the animal perceives that stimulus. But biology doesn't work that way. Biology is random, and finicky — proteins flip-flop from one conformation to another, neurotransmitters drift across synapses, and ions careen about the cell. All of this means that there's a high degree of randomness in how neurons behave. We use the tools of probability to get a handle on that randomness — to model how neurons work, to understand the role they play in behavior, and to figure out what their activity patterns mean.\n",

There are actually a few different answers to this question, and next week we will focus on one that you might not have thought of before.

The sense of smell is really important to mice: the whole front chunk of the mouse brain is devoted to processing smell information. So understanding this sniffing behavior could help you get a better grasp on how mice interact with and understand their environments.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 50 behaviors total in the sample space, and 30 of them include sniffing, so the probability of the mouse sniffing in the next trial is 0.6. \n",
    "\n",
    "I've been glossing over a really important detail, however. We defined the sample space as the set of ***all possible outcomes*** — how can we possibly enumerate all of the possible behaviors a mouse might engage in in 5 seconds? Strictly speaking, the sample space is infinite. We could never count up all those possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of approaches to managing this problem. The first is to partition the sample space in a reasonable way: to consider not specific outcomes, but rather well-chosen sets of outcomes, as the elements of the sample space. The second is to approximate the sample space by running your experiment repeatedly and collecting the results — or by looking at the results that the same random process has produced in the past. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's start with partitioning.** What does this look like in practice? First, there's one important constraint here — if we want to be able to count up the elements in our event, and then find the probability of the event by dividing that number by the size of our sample space, then all of the elements in the sample space need to be equally likely. (You could also create a sample space with elements that are not all equally likely, but that makes things much more complicated.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example. Imagine you are going to flip a coin infinitely many times. What are the odds the first flip will come up heads? If you wanted to make a complete sample space here, the number of outcomes would be infinite, because you are going to flip the coin infinitely many times. But there's clearly a much easier way to do this — we can just partition that infinite sample space into one set that includes all of the outcomes where the first flip comes up heads, and another set where the first flip comes up tails. So our partitioned sample space has 2 elements, and our event contains 1 — the probability of the first flip coming up heads is 0.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a real-world situation you might have to approximate a bit, but the general idea still holds. Let's say that you know the mouse can be in one of 5 states on each trial — tired, hungry, friendly, curious, and bored — and that these states are approximately equally likely. You also know that the mouse sniffs when hungry, curious, or friendly, but will not sniff if tired or bored. There could be tons of other behaviors that may or may not happen in these states, but your partitioning allows you to safely ignore them. Here's what your sample space will look like:\n",

    "---\n",
    "height: 400px\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of sniffing is then clearly $\\frac{3}{5}$, or 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The second approach is even simpler** — just approximate the sample space using data. For the mouse experiment, we might approximate the sample space by collecting all the trials we have run so far, and then counting up the number of them that included sniffing. For the weather problem, that might look like collecting all the days in our historical weather data that have similar conditions to tomorrow (same time of year, same weather on the previous day, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, this is often how we think about probability. If you want to know the chances that you'll miss your alarm tomorrow, for example, you'll probably think about all the days in recent memory when you went to bed at the same time and calculate the fraction of those days where you overslept."
